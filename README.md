# Bioinformatics-analysis

## Overview

**Bioinformatics-analysis** is an open-source repository focused on building a **reproducible RNA-Seq data analysis workflow**, covering essential steps from raw sequencing data quality control to gene expression quantification and visualization.

This project is intended both as a **hands-on learning resource** and a **portfolio-ready example**, demonstrating practical bioinformatics skills using widely adopted tools in computational biology and genomics.

---

## Project Goals

- Build a complete RNA-Seq analysis workflow  
- Apply reproducible and transparent bioinformatics practices  
- Organize quality control reports, scripts, and results in a clear structure  
- Gain hands-on experience with industry-standard bioinformatics tools  

---

## Workflow Summary

1. Quality control of raw FASTQ files  
2. Splice-aware alignment to a reference genome  
3. Gene-level read quantification  
4. Aggregation of QC reports  
5. Visualization and preparation for downstream analysis

## Tools & Technologies

This repository makes use of the following tools:

- **FastQC** – Quality control of raw sequencing reads  
- **STAR Aligner** – Splice-aware alignment of RNA-Seq reads to the reference genome  
- **featureCounts** – Efficient read counting and generation of gene count matrices  
- **MultiQC** – Aggregation of multiple QC reports into a single interactive report  
- **Linux / Bash** – Pipeline execution, automation, and file management  
- **Python** – Data visualization and result plotting scripts  
- **R** – Visualization and preparation for downstream statistical analysis  

---

## Repository Contents

- FastQC quality control reports  
- MultiQC summary reports  
- Python scripts for RNA-Seq data visualization  
- Gene count tables and result charts  
- Output files generated from real RNA-Seq datasets  

---

## Reproducibility & Best Practices

This project emphasizes:

- Clear and consistent directory structure  
- Version-controlled analysis outputs  
- Transparent and reproducible workflows  
- Use of open-source and community-validated bioinformatics tools  

All results and scripts are stored to allow reuse, inspection, and further development.

## Future Work

Planned extensions to this repository include:

- Differential Expression Analysis using **DESeq2**  
- Functional enrichment analysis (GO / pathway analysis)  
- Workflow automation with tools such as **Snakemake** or **Nextflow**  
- Integration of additional RNA-Seq datasets  

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is suitable for:

- Students learning **bioinformatics and RNA-Seq analysis**  
- Researchers interested in **reproducible NGS workflows**  
- Recruiters or collaborators reviewing practical bioinformatics projects
